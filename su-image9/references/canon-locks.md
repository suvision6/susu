本文件是 `su-image9` 唯一由人工维护的 canon 源。`SKILL.md` 和其他 reference 不复制完整锁块；validator 运行时直接解析并计算本文件哈希，不保存或维护锁块快照。

本文件必须且只能定义以下四个唯一块。缺版本、缺块、重复块、未知块、截断或哈希漂移均为合同失败。修改任一块必须升级 `canon-version`。

### canon:HARD_PHRASES

```text
Generate one wide horizontal 16:9 canvas containing a clean 3x3 storyboard grid.
Each of the 9 panels must also be a horizontal 16:9 storyboard frame.
Use the declared PAGE_SPATIAL_ANCHOR for spatial continuity across the entire 3x3 grid.
Preserve source-shot order and every source shot's original camera composition.
Do not redesign the room, exterior location, furniture footprint, terrain, road, doorway, vehicle position, or object positions in later panels.
Do not generate any text, labels, captions, panel numbers, scene headers, shot numbers, subtitles, arrows, or watermarks inside the image.
```

### canon:GEOMETRY_BLUEPRINT

```text
Strict panel geometry blueprint, mandatory before drawing:
Treat the final canvas as a clean wide horizontal 16:9 layout.
Draw exactly nine separate straight rectangular panel frames with visible gutters.
Arrange the 9 panels in a clean 3x3 storyboard grid: three equal columns and three equal rows.
All 9 panels must have the same width, the same height, the same 16:9 aspect ratio, and aligned edges.
Each panel frame must remain a flat horizontal 16:9 rectangle.
Do not let any panel become square, vertical, tall, narrow, compressed, stretched, trapezoid, diagonal, rounded, or irregular.
Keep gutters and margins as empty separating space. If a close-up needs more room, use empty background or negative space inside that panel; never change the panel shape or aspect ratio.
Do not create 3:2, 4:3, A4, square, vertical, mixed-size, manga, comic, collage, or poster layouts.
Do not create a manga page, comic page, dynamic collage, masonry grid, mixed panel sizes, tilted frames, perspective-distorted frames, overlapping panels, or a poster composition.
The content inside a panel may crop or zoom, but the panel frame itself must remain a flat horizontal 16:9 rectangle.
Geometry correctness does not replace the SYSTEM_STYLE_LAYER. The 3x3 grid must remain geometrically strict while all panel contents remain in the same monochrome graphite storyboard production style.
```

### canon:SYSTEM_STYLE_LAYER

```text
SYSTEM_STYLE_LAYER:
This entire generation must follow a single unified storyboard production style.

STYLE ANCHOR:
Treat this as a single cohesive storyboard drawn by one graphite storyboard artist in a single production session. For batch generation, all outputs must match the same storyboard artist, same production session, same medium, same stroke weight, same shading density, and same unfinished storyboard look.

MEDIUM:
Monochrome graphite storyboard / pencil pre-visualization drawing only. Hand-drawn pencil / graphite sketch only. Production storyboard sheet. Animatic frame design. Non-painting, non-rendered, non-illustration.

LINE RULE:
Thin graphite linework only. Visible sketch strokes allowed. Construction lines allowed. Rough drafting lines allowed. No inked comic outlines. No polished clean manga line art.

SHADING RULE:
Light hatching only. Mid-gray tonal range. Controlled medium contrast only. No pure black fill blocks. No heavy ink fill. No painterly shading. No soft airbrush gradients.

TEXTURE RULE:
Paper-like sketch texture. Slightly rough graphite grain. High-frequency pencil texture. Unfinished production drawing aesthetic.

RENDERING RULE:
No digital painting, no photorealism, no CGI, no cinematic lighting, no bloom, no HDR lighting, no volumetric god rays, no depth-of-field blur, no airbrush gradients, no rendered concept art look.

CONSISTENCY RULE:
All 9 panels must share identical drawing style, graphite medium, stroke weight, shading density, texture grain, tonal range, and rendering restraint. No stylistic variation between panels is allowed.

### canon:NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINTS

```text
NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINTS:
No photorealism, no film still look, no realistic skin texture, no cinematic lighting, no cinematic grading, no HDR lighting, no bloom, no volumetric god rays, no depth-of-field blur, no CGI, no 3D render, no digital painting, no digital illustration look, no rendered concept art, no polished illustration, no watercolor, no oil painting, no painterly shading, no soft airbrush gradients, no anime rendering, no manga page, no comic page layout, no inked comic outlines, no clean manga line art, no dynamic collage, no masonry grid, no poster composition, no color, no pure black fill blocks, no heavy ink fill, no text inside the image, no labels, no subtitles, no arrows, no watermarks, no square panels, no vertical panels, no tall panels, no narrow panels, no mixed-size panels.
